# Events Package
## Description
As discussed in previous sections events a cornerstone of the actor-model approach. In some cases we want to have a way to share the logic between frontend and backend. Luckily the we can use the `events` package to have a common implementation for both fromt- and backend.

## Implementation
For this approach we will be using the same implementation as we did for the [dom example](../2-DomEventTarget).

## Resources
[events] - a library meant to mimic the same functionality as the Node EventEmitter
